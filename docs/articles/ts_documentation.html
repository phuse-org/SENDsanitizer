<p>STUDYID and TSVAL column have value that differ from original data.
Blue background represents all the values that replaced with synthetic
value. When it is empty, that’s mean value removed (in otherword,
replaced with empty string(’’)). Red text in TSPARMCD is just a visual
guide what changes in TSVAL.</p>
